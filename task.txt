Task
Develop a standalone Linux App called ELab-Test. ELab-Test app is a computer monitoring tool which is used for visualizing data on WolkAbout IoT Platform.
It needs to be implemented as a console app and runnable on any Linux machine. Develop app in C or C++ programming language and in according with chosen language use one of the WolkConnect libraries.

1 Create device
Create device on WolkAbout Platform using given requirements.

2 Monitoring IP address
Implement monitoring of current IP address every 5 min. Publish it to the platform only if it's changed from initial address.
Note: "IP_ADD" is IP address reference on WolkAbout IoT Platform.

3 Monitoring CPU temperature
Implement monitoring CPU temperature every minute. Publish the maximum value within a 5 minute timeframe to the platform.
Note: "CPU_T" is temperature reference.

4 Logging
Log all activities both in-app and to file while running. Configuring logging level (INFO and DEBUG) should be able to be changed from WolkAbout IoT Platform by editing device's configuration options.
Note: "LOG_LEVEL" is logging level reference.

Deploying Task
Create a Git Repository on your personal account that will use the Wolkabout library of choice as a submodule. Use CMake as a build system. Develop task and create a Pull Request for each point. The output should be a linux terminal application.
Device Feeds:
CPU Temperature, Temperature, IP Address, Device Status
Device In/Out Feeds:
Log Level


//TODO
1. Put submodule of WolkAbout library to personal Github
2. Create CMake with library linking
3. In out/ folder cmake ..
